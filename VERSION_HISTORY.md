# How I created my site

### v1.0.0
I wanted to set myself a challenge. One day to design and build a website.

I had some time to kill on a bank holiday and I wanted to see what I could do in a few hours.

I started on Figma. Creating 7 designs. None of them will be the final design but I thought I could code these within my set time frame.

I then used Nuxt to create the site and Netlify to deploy.

### v1.1.*
I had another afternoon free and I wanted to improve my Lighthouse Audit scores.

These score are calculated with:

```
Network: Fast 3G
CPU: 4x slowdown
```

### v1.2.* and v1.3.*
Another bank holiday means, I had a day to make some more changes.

I started by making the text in my hero animate. I wanted to make it look like I was typing the message.

I then made some breakpoint styles changes. As some things bugged me from how my site worked on mobile and tablet.

I finally added the contact form that I designed for on my initial challenge.
