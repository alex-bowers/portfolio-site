# How I created my site

### v1.0.0
I wanted to set myself a challenge. One day to design and build a website.

I had some time to kill on a bank holiday and I wanted to see what I could do in a few hours.

I started on Figma. Creating 7 designs. None of them will be the final design but I thought I could code these within my set time frame.

I then used Nuxt to create the site and Netlify to deploy.

### v1.1.*
I had another afternoon free and I wanted to improve my Lighthouse Audit scores.

These score are calculated with:

```
Network: Fast 3G
CPU: 4x slowdown
```

### v1.2.* and v1.3.*
Another bank holiday means, I had a day to make some more changes.

I started by making the text in my hero animate. I wanted to make it look like I was typing the message.

I then made some breakpoint styles changes. As some things bugged me from how my site worked on mobile and tablet.

I finally added the contact form that I designed for on my initial challenge.

### v1.4.*, v1.5.* and v1.6.*

Over the next six months, I spent a few days trying new things out.

These releases were mostly visual changes but I did fix the contact form as well.

Once I starting throwing in some SVG animations, I knew I had taken this design too far. It didn't make sense any more and the site performance took a hit. So I started to design v2.

### v2.0.0

I had to take a days annual leave and decided it was time to create v2.

I used movie posters from my favourite film (The Thomas Crown Affair, 1968) as inspiration for the design.

The idea was to remove the visual clutter but make a more complex responsive design.

### v3.0.0
It's been a few years and I wanted to refresh my site.

I kept getting notifications about outdated dependencies and I didn't need any of them. Previously, my site was built on Nuxt and that was just because I wanted to play with it and I had plan to scale my portfolio up.

I decided to keep the style and simply remove Nuxt. This site is now a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript site. I have used Vite and Netlify functions because I wanted to play with them.
