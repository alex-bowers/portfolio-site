# My Website

### v1.0.0
I wanted to set myself a challenge. One day to design and build a website.

I had some time to kill on a bank holiday and I wanted to see what I could do in a few hours.

I started on Figma. Creating 7 designs. None of them will be the final design but I thought I could code these within my set time frame.

I then used Nuxt to create the site and Netlify to deploy.

### v1.1.2
I had another afternoon free and I wanted to improve my Lighthouse Audit scores.

These score are calculated with: 

```
Network: Fast 3G
CPU: 4x slowdown
```
